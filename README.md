# Product Roadmap

This repo contains features for ParlezVous, irrespective of where the code might live.

Oftentimes, a feature will span multiple projects (ex, a "logging in" feature requires front end and back end work).

Additionally, proposals are to be made in this repo as well in the form of a GitHub issue.

Current Project:

**MVP**: https://github.com/orgs/parlez-vous/projects/2
